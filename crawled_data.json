Unfortunately, constructing an accurate dataset of AS-to-organization mappings is difficult due to a lack of ground truth information. CAIDA AS-to-organization (CA2O), the current state-of-the-art dataset, relies heavily on Whois databases maintained by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) to infer the AS-to-organization mappings. However,inaccuracies in Whois data can dramatically impact the accuracy of CA2O, particularly for inferences involving ASes owned by the same organization (referred to as sibling ASes). In this work, we leverage PeeringDB (PDB) as an additional data source to detect potential errors of sibling relations in CA2O. By conducting a meticulous semi-manual investigation, we discover two pitfalls of using Whois data that result in incorrect inferences in CA2O. We then systematically analyze how these pitfalls influence CA2O. We also build an improved dataset on sibling relations, which corrects the mappings of 12.5% of CA2O organizations with sibling ASes (1,028 CA2O organizations, associated with 3,772 ASNs). To make this process reproducible and scalable, we design an automated approach to recreate our manually-built dataset with high fidelity. The approach is able to automatically improve inferences of sibling ASes for each new version of CA2O."},

MANRS members must register their IP prefixes in a trusted routing database and use such information to prevent propagation of invalid routing information. MANRS membership has increased significantly in recent years, but the impact of the MANRS initiative on the overall Internet routing security remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first independent look into the MANRS ecosystem by using publicly available data to analyze the routing behavior of participant networks. We quantify MANRS participants’ level of conformance with the stated requirements, and compare the behavior of MANRS and non-MANRS networks. While not all MANRS members fully comply with all required actions, we find that they are more likely to implement routing security practices described in MANRS actions. We assess the relevance of the MANRS effort in securing the overall routing ecosystem. We found that as of May 2022, over 83% of MANRS networks were conformant to the route filtering requirement by dropping BGP messages with invalid information according to authoritative records, and over 95% were conformant to the routing information facilitation requirement, registering their resources in authoritative databases."},

After many unsuccessful attempts to deploy additional security mechanisms for BGP, we now witness increasing adoption of the RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure). The RPKI allows network operators to register their BGP prefixes together with the legitimate Autonomous System (AS) number that may originate them via BGP, backed by strong cryptography. Recent research shows an encouraging trend: An increasing number of networks around the globe start to register their prefixes in the RPKI. While encouraging, the actual benefit of registering prefixes in the RPKI eventually depends on whether transit providers in the Internet enforce the RPKI’s contents, i.e., configure their routers to validate prefix announcements and filter invalid BGP announcements. In this work, we present a broad empirical study tackling the question: To what degree does registration in the RPKI protect a network from illicit announcements of their prefixes, such as prefix hijacks? To this end, we first present a longitudinal study of filtering behavior of transit providers in the Internet, and second we carry out a detailed study of the visibility of legitimate and illegitimate prefix announcements in the global routing table, contrasting prefixes registered in the RPKI with those not regis- tered. Our results indicate that an increasing number of transit providers indeed do enforce RPKI filtering, which translates to a direct benefit for the networks using the RPKI in the case of illicit announcements of their address space. Our findings bode well for further RPKI adoption and for increasing routing security in today’s and tomorrow’s Internet."},

However, because of the immense global influence of the Internet, other national governments and international organizations are seeking to rapidly become involved in this policy-development sphere. In this particularly decisive moment of the Internet, there is a need to understand the structure and processes of ICANN before any further change. This paper studies who participates in ICANN’s decision-making and policy-development processes and how. It first examines in detail the internal structure of the organization, and then its structural and financial evolution since its inception. The study is an in-depth analysis of legal, financial and public documents of ICANN, as well as the information published directly by ICANN’s internal bodies. Although other works have studied specific internal bodies of ICANN, this is the first comprehensive examination of ICANN using ICANN’s founding documents as starting point. The paper reveals the substantial expansion in scale and scope of ICANN’s initial technical mandate. ICANN’s recurring changes allowed it to adapt to growth, evolution and change in the Internet However, the permanent restructuring hinders follow-up by external interested parties that are now requesting more involvement in the policy- development processes."},

Although the first version of BGP was published in 1989 and its lack of security mechanisms has been known since then, BGP remains vulnerable to attacks that can cause large scale outages or can be used for other malicious purposes on the Internet, such as traffic sniffing or spam sending. Moreover, the lack of security has not prevented the surge of new applications that run on top of the Internet, making tampering with BGP increasingly attractive. As an example, BGP hijacking was used to steal at least $83,000 worth of cryptocurrency in 2014, and again more recently in April 2018. Thus, securing BGP is key to increasing the overall security of the Internet ecosystem. This paper offers a historical review of the different ideas put forward to secure inter-domain routing and what happened to these ideas along the way, noting if they were implemented and are in use, the impact they had on other proposals, and other characteristics explaining the difficulty of securing BGP. This study analyzes 10 BGP extensions focused on BGP availability, 7 BGP extensions and best practices focused on securing BGP communication and routing information, and 11 security proposals coming from the research and industry communities. It examines where the ideas came from, the implicit trust delegation and the residual vulnerabilities of proposals. Even though performance and incentives of specific security solutions have been largely discussed, most proposals have not even been implemented, limiting the overall security improvement of BGP. Reviewing the full life cycle of the proposed ideas, the trusted actors and mechanisms and their requirements gives insight into why adoptions rate are so limited. In fact, there is a remarkable lack of consensus on what needs to be secured or validated, and the approach to be taken, preventing solutions to get critical support to move their deployment forward. Additionally, no BGP security mechanism, even the most narrow one, has been easily implemented and deployed. However, there are security best practices that certainly improve local and overall BGP security. Since no solution comes without costs and all proposal have opponents in network operation community, it may be possible that secure routing should be provided as a separate service from routing, and other entities could offer such solutions."},

While hijack detection systems are readily available, they typically rely on a priori prefix-ownership information and are reactive in nature. In this work, we take on a new perspective on BGP hijacking activity: we introduce and track the long-term network behavior of serial hijackers, networks that repeatedly hijack address blocks for malicious purposes, often over the course of many months or even years. Based on a ground-truth dataset that we construct by extracting information from operator mailing lists, we illuminate the dominant network characteristics of serial hijackers, and how they differ from legitimate networks. We then distill features that can capture these behavioral differences and train a machine learning model to automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics similar to serial hijackers. Our classifier identifies some ~1,000 potentially misbehaving ASes in the global IPv4 routing table. We analyze and categorize these networks, finding a wide range of indicators both for malicious activity, misconfiguration, as well as benign cases of hijacking activity. Our work presents a solid first step towards identifying and understanding this important category of networks, which can aid network operators in taking proactive measures to defend themselves against prefix hijacking and serve as input for current and future detection systems."},

For the operational dimension, we characterize the temporal activity of ASNs in the Internet control plane using BGP data collected by the RouteViews and RIPE RIS projects. We present a methodology to extract insights about AS life cycles, including dealing with pitfalls affecting authoritative public datasets.

We characterize the usual behaviors, specific differences between RIRs and historical resources, as well as measure the discrepancies between the two łparallelž lives.

They are operationally complex and expensive to implement and provide little competitive advantage. The practices with significant uptake protect only against origin hijacks, leaving unresolved the more general threat of path hijacks. We propose a new approach to improved routing security that achieves four design goals: improved incentive alignment to implement best practices; protection against path hijacks; expanded scope of such protection to customers of those engaged in the practices; and reliance on existing capabilities rather than needing complex new software in every participating router. Our proposal leverages an existing coherent core of interconnected ISPs to create a zone of trust, a topological region that protects not only all networks in the region, but all directly attached customers of those networks. Customers benefit from choosing ISPs committed to the practices, and ISPs thus benefit from committing to the practices. We discuss the concept of a zone of trust as a new, more pragmatic approach to security, that improves security in a region of the Internet, as opposed to striving for a global improvement. We argue that the aspiration for global improvement is unrealistic, since the global Internet includes malicious actors. We compare our approach to other schemes, and discuss how a related proposal, ASPA, could be used to increase the scope of protection our scheme achieves. We hope this proposal inspires discussion of how the industry can make practical, measurable progress against the threat of route hijacks in the short term by leveraging institutionalized cooperation rooted in transparency and accountability."},

RPKI is a crypto system, with associated complexity and policy challenges; it has seen substantial but slowing adoption. IRR databases often contain inaccurate records due to lack of validation standards. Given the widespread use of IRR for routing security purposes, this inaccuracy merits further study. We study IRR accuracy by quantifying the consistency between IRR and RPKI records, analyze the causes of inconsistency, and look at which ASes are contributing correct IRR information. In October 2021, we found ROAs for around 20% of RADB IRR records, and a consistency of 38% and 60% in v4 and v6.

Inter-domain routing is a core Internet protocol that enables traffic to flow globally across independent networks. Concerns about Internet infrastructure security have prompted policymakers to promote stronger routing security and the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) in particular. RPKI is a cryptographic framework to secure routing that was standardized in 2012. In 2024, almost 50% of routed IP address blocks are still not covered by RPKI certificates. It is unclear what barriers are preventing networks from adopting RPKI. This paper investigates networks with low RPKI adoption to understand where and why adoption is low or non-existent. We find that networks’ geographical area of service, size, business category and complexity of address space delegation impact RPKI adoption. Our analysis may help direct policymakers’ efforts to promote RPKI adoption and improve the state of routing security."},

{"url": "https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~fujimoto/", "keywords": "Richard Fujimoto is a Regents’ Professor, Emeritus in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California-Berkeley in 1983 in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. He also received an M.S. degree from the same institution as well as two B.S. degrees from the University of Illinois-Urbana. Fujimoto is a pioneer in the parallel and distributed discrete event simulation field. Discrete event simulation is widely used in areas such as telecommunications, transportation, manufacturing, and defense, among others. His work developed fundamental understandings of synchronization algorithms that are needed to ensure the correct execution of discrete event simulation programs on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. His team developed many new algorithms and computational techniques to accelerate the execution of discrete event simulations and developed software realizations that impacted several application domains. For example, his Georgia Tech Time Warp software was deployed by MITRE Corp. to create online fast-time simulations of commercial air traffic to help reduce delays in the U.S. National Airspace. An active researcher in this field since 1985, he authored or co-authored three books and hundreds of technical papers including seven that were cited for “best paper” awards or other recognitions. His research included several projects with Georgia Tech faculty in telecommunications, transportation, sustainability, and materials leading to numerous publications co-authored with faculty across campus. Fujimoto led the definition of the time management services in the High Level Architecture (HLA) for Modeling and Simulation that ensure proper synchronization of distributed simulations. HLA was designated as the standard technical architecture for all modeling and simulation in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in 1996, thereby forming the basis for simulation interoperability across the entire DoD. Standardized as IEEE 1516, it continues to be used to this day. Software implementations of the services he developed have been realized by corporations such as CAE, General Dynamics, Mitsubishi, Raytheon, Pitch and Mak, among others, as well as an HPC version developed by his group at Georgia Tech. He received the ACM SIGSIM Distinguished Contributions in Simulation Award and the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education (I/ITSEC) Fellow Award in recognition of his contributions to the field. He is a fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and SCS. At Georgia Tech Fujimoto was the founding chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) from 2005 to 2014. In that role he was the architect of interdisciplinary educational programs bridging the College of Computing with the rest of campus, especially the College of Engineering and the College of Sciences. He led the creation of the M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs in CSE that span numerous schools across campus. He led the creation of the College of Computing’s first on-line distance learning program, the M.S. program in CSE. At the undergraduate level he led the Computational-X initiative that resulted in the creation of two new undergraduate minors for students outside the College of Computing. He contributed to the development of Georgia Tech’s M.S. program in Analytics as well as its M.S. program in Urban Analytics, again with faculty in several other units across campus. A strong advocate for diversity, he played a leading role in the creation of the CRUISE (Computing Research Undergraduate Intern Summer Experience) program featuring outreach to women and minority students, personally supervised numerous African-American undergraduates, and served as the advisor for the first African-American student to receive the Ph. D. degree from Georgia Tech’s CSE program. As CSE school chair his accomplishments include growing the school to 13 tenure track faculty and building the school’s administrative staff. Under his leadership, the school was formally established as an academic unit (the School of Computational Science and Engineering) at Georgia Tech in 2010. He received many Georgia Tech awards including the institute-wide Class of 1934 Outstanding Interdisciplinary Activities Award, the Outstanding Service Award, and the Outstanding Achievement in Research Program Development Award as well as numerous College of Computing awards. | Richard Fujimoto"},

He received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California-Berkeley in 1983 in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. He also received an M.S. degree from the same institution as well as two B.S. degrees from the University of Illinois-Urbana. Fujimoto is a pioneer in the parallel and distributed discrete event simulation field. Discrete event simulation is widely used in areas such as telecommunications, transportation, manufacturing, and defense, among others. His work developed fundamental understandings of synchronization algorithms that are needed to ensure the correct execution of discrete event simulation programs on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. His team developed many new algorithms and computational techniques to accelerate the execution of discrete event simulations and developed software realizations that impacted several application domains. For example, his Georgia Tech Time Warp software was deployed by MITRE Corp. to create online fast-time simulations of commercial air traffic to help reduce delays in the U.S. National Airspace. An active researcher in this field since 1985, he authored or co-authored three books and hundreds of technical papers including seven that were cited for “best paper” awards or other recognitions. His research included several projects with Georgia Tech faculty in telecommunications, transportation, sustainability, and materials leading to numerous publications co-authored with faculty across campus. Fujimoto led the definition of the time management services in the High Level Architecture (HLA) for Modeling and Simulation that ensure proper synchronization of distributed simulations. HLA was designated as the standard technical architecture for all modeling and simulation in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in 1996, thereby forming the basis for simulation interoperability across the entire DoD. Standardized as IEEE 1516, it continues to be used to this day. Software implementations of the services he developed have been realized by corporations such as CAE, General Dynamics, Mitsubishi, Raytheon, Pitch and Mak, among others, as well as an HPC version developed by his group at Georgia Tech. He received the ACM SIGSIM Distinguished Contributions in Simulation Award and the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education (I/ITSEC) Fellow Award in recognition of his contributions to the field. He is a fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and SCS. At Georgia Tech Fujimoto was the founding chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) from 2005 to 2014. In that role he was the architect of interdisciplinary educational programs bridging the College of Computing with the rest of campus, especially the College of Engineering and the College of Sciences. He led the creation of the M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs in CSE that span numerous schools across campus. He led the creation of the College of Computing’s first on-line distance learning program, the M.S. program in CSE. At the undergraduate level he led the Computational-X initiative that resulted in the creation of two new undergraduate minors for students outside the College of Computing. He contributed to the development of Georgia Tech’s M.S. program in Analytics as well as its M.S. program in Urban Analytics, again with faculty in several other units across campus. A strong advocate for diversity, he played a leading role in the creation of the CRUISE (Computing Research Undergraduate Intern Summer Experience) program featuring outreach to women and minority students, personally supervised numerous African-American undergraduates, and served as the advisor for the first African-American student to receive the Ph. D. degree from Georgia Tech’s CSE program. As CSE school chair his accomplishments include growing the school to 13 tenure track faculty and building the school’s administrative staff. Under his leadership, the school was formally established as an academic unit (the School of Computational Science and Engineering) at Georgia Tech in 2010. He received many Georgia Tech awards including the institute-wide Class of 1934 Outstanding Interdisciplinary Activities Award, the Outstanding Service Award, and the Outstanding Achievement in Research Program Development Award as well as numerous College of Computing awards. | Richard Fujimoto"},

Common examples of amorphous materials include granular materials (salt, uncooked rice), fluids (honey), and visco-plastic materials (sticky rice, softened butter).  A typical task is to spread a given material out across a flat surface using a tool such as a scraper or knife.  We use reinforcement learning to train our controllers to manipulate materials in various ways.   The training is performed in a physics simulator that uses position-based dynamics of particles to simulate the materials to be manipulated.  The neural network control policy is given observations of the material (e.g. a low-resolution density map), and the policy outputs actions such as rotating and translating the knife.  We demonstrate policies that have been successfully trained to carry out the following tasks: spreading, gathering, and flipping.  We produce a final animation by using inverse kinematics to guide a character's arm and hand to match the motion of the manipulation tool such as a knife or a frying pan."},

We propose techniques for caching the results of queries to accelerate exploratory statistical analysis. Accelerating DDL Operations Students: Teju Nareddy, Grace Harper, and Sai Gundlapalli Schema changes often require large amounts of data to be moved from table to table, thereby straining system resources and increasing the likelihood of errors. We seek to design a faster DDL implementation that allows for near-instantaneous schema modifications while reducing the run-time impact on subsequent queries. VQL …"},
